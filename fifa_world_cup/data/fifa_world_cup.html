      <li> African countries were not doing well in the world cup and I believe in some years to come in future they will do well and any can Be the winner. Lets have hope we Africans. (Profesa Beka, June 2022)
        <ul>
          <li> Not until African countries start selection of players based on merit and not by who can buy his place in team or by influence of some people in authority, this dream will take a long time to come true.        Africa is harvest of talents in all areas of sports, the problem is management. ( from Uyo Oghene, Nov 2022)<br>
